Due to the current US political climate, Planned Parenthood is likely 
to be defunded by the federal government. As a result, less people will 
have access to essential reproductive health services, particularly in 
some of the most economically vulnerable areas. This site aims to provide 
options for people looking to receive this care, with or without Planned
Parenthood access.
